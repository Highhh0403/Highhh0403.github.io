By considering the mandates of the Department of Health and the legal implications of the Republic Act No. 11469 (otherwise known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act of 2020), the school prepared itself for the upcoming quarantine days; so business transactions and other academic related tasks will still fall normal under the new normal.
